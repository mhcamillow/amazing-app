"# amazing-app" 

Hey, you need OpenCV to run this.

Use this tutorials to configure it:
  
  http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_setup/py_table_of_contents_setup/py_table_of_contents_setup.html#py-table-of-content-setup

You also need to point the correct locations for the haar files, at the VideoHandler.py file, and the video you want to use at the AmazingApp.py (or just pass 0 or -1 as a parameter to use your webcam).
